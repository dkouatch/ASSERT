# ASSERT: A Software Suite for Earth-systems Regression Testing
### About
This repository showcases my work during the summer of 2023 on ASSERT during my internship with Science Systems and Applications, Inc. In this internship, I worked on ASSERT (A Software Suite for Earth-systems Regression Testing) with the Advanced Software Technology Group within NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. It contains the code I developed and my PowerPoint that I used in presentations towards the end of my internship.
